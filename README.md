**Zero-Knowledge ID Check**

Using a ZK-Snark, this age verification app checks if you are older than 21 without the client or server ever knowing your age.

Using zksnarkjs and the Plonk ZK-Snark Algorithm, the client converts your input and runs a DAG arithmetic circuit in WASM to present a mathmatical proof of your age to verify.
